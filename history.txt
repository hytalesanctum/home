These are the names for my Hytale civilization server with 4 civilizations, give me alternative names, matching each zone (1 to 4).Here are alternative names for your four Hytale civilization server factions, matched to each zone (1-4) based on their themes from the game:
Zone 1: Aethethelian alternatives (Ethereal forest/nature theme - lush groves, plains, trees, peaceful vibes like Kweebecs):

Sylvarithians (evoking ancient woodland guardians)
Verdelorians (from "vermilion" greens and lore)
Gaianthari (tied to earth's nurturing essence)

Zone 2: Empyyrrean alternatives (Celestial empire/sky theme - deserts, ruins, wind-swept dunes):

Celestari (starry nomad rulers of the sands)
Zephyrions (wind lords of endless horizons)
Solarae (sun-empowered desert sovereigns)

Zone 3: Fawfildian alternatives (Fungal wilderness/mushroom theme - cold forests, swamps, wild growth):

Mycorath (spore-shrouded wildfolk)
Fungariel (mushroom-rooted wanderers)
Thornsporeans (prickly, overgrown marsh dwellers)

Zone 4: Scarakakian alternatives (Scarab/campfire survival theme - volcanic wastes, underground lairs):

Infernarak (fire-scarred beetle warriors)
Ashkarans (campfire forge survivors)
Volcanthids (magma-dwelling scarab kin)

These keep the fancy, repeated-letter style (like "Aethethelian") for a mythical feel, while tying into Hytale's official zones: Zone 1 (Emerald Grove/Wilds), Zone 2 (Howling Sands), Zone 3 (Borea/Whisperfrost), Zone 4 (Devastated Lands). Pick one per civ or mix for your server!60 sourcesI chose Empyrean (zone 1), Zephyreon (zone 2), and Ashkaran (zone 4). I need one for zone 3, maybe with boreal or frost, or smt related to greek myhtology (cold, etc.)2 / 2Perfect picks! Your set—Empyrean (Zone 1: ethereal/nature), Zephyreon (Zone 2: wind/sky), Ashkaran (Zone 4: ash/volcanic)—pairs beautifully with these Zone 3 alternatives (Boreal cold forests/swamps/fungi theme). I've infused Greek mythology (Boreas north wind/winter god, Khione snow goddess/daughter of Boreas, Cheimon winter personification) for that frosty mythical vibe, keeping the repeated-letter elegance:

Boreareans (Boreal frost-wind folk, evoking Boreas' icy gales over taiga woods)
Khyoneans (Snow-shrouded mushroom mystics, from Khione's chilling embrace)
Cheimorians (Winter-spore wilders, tied to Cheimon's eternal boreal freeze)

These nod to Zone 3's wintry valleys, snowy pines, and fragile fungal life while matching your celestial/epic style. I'd go with Boreareans—it echoes "boreal" directly (from Boreas) and flows with Zephyreon!38 sourcesNah, moreHere are more Zone 3 alternatives (Boreal frosty taiga/swamps/fungi theme), drawing deeper from Greek myth's winter figures like Boreas (north wind/winter god), Khione (snow goddess, his daughter), Cheimon (winter personification), Oreithyia (mountain gale Boreas abducted), kryos/pagos (frost/ice), and Hytale's "Borea" zone name:

Pagoreans (Frost-forged spore guardians, from "pagos" ice + repeated elegance)
Oreithians (Gale-shrouded boreal mystics, honoring Boreas' stormy bride in icy wilds)
Kryonians (Chill-spore boreal wanderers, evoking "kryos" for crystalline frost over mushrooms)
Auraians (Winter wind-haunted fungi folk, from Aurae/Anemoi winds + Boreas' chill)
Chioneans (Snow-veiled taiga spore lords, variant of Khione's eternal freeze)

These amplify the frosty Greek vibes while syncing with Zone 3's snowy pines, fragile cave life, and mushroom motifs. Pagoreans stands out—crisp, icy, and pairs perfectly with your Empyrean/Zephyreon/Ashkaran epicness!50 sourcesAlright, chose Pagoreans, now with these role, make me a message to tell players to chose their civilization, they can only chose 1.🌌 Welcome to the World of Orbis – Choose Your Civilization! 🌌

Feel free to tweak it if you want it shorter or more personal!What would be the name of the civilization, not the name by which the inhabitants are called2 / 2Here are fitting civilization names (the official name of the faction/empire itself, not the demonym for its people) that match the style and themes of your server:

Empyrean → The Empyrean Dominion
(or simply Empyrea for a shorter, ancient-sounding name)
Zephyreon → The Zephyreon Concord
(or Zephyria, evoking endless skies and wind kingdoms)
Pagoreans → The Pagorean Ascendancy
(or Pagorea, a cold, mystical boreal realm)
Ashkaran → The Ashkaran Forges
(or Ashkara, a volcanic empire of fire and scarabs)

Recommended clean set (short & epic):

Empyrea
Zephyria
Pagorea
Ashkara

These feel like proper civilization/empire names (similar to "Rome", "Atlantis", "Valyria", "Wakanda") while keeping the mythical, repeated-letter vibe of your original choices.
Which direction do you like best — the longer "The X Dominion/Concord/etc." style, or the shorter single-word realm names?
